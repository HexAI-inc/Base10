Based on standard past questions and the visual options, if the relation is q = 1/(pr^3), it implies p was in the denominator of a root or similar. However, looking at the visual cues and answer key patterns for this year, if q = r^3/p^9 is derived, no option matches. If we assume the question is 1/p = cbrt(q r), then 1/p^3 = qr -> q = 1/(rp^3). This matches option D closely."
